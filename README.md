# Study Saturdays: Week 3 - React-Redux

## **Objective:** Build an app to display students and their test scores

- [ ] **Cycle 0:** Build the store ⭐️
- [ ] **Cycle 1:** `connect` the React component
- [ ] **Cycle 2:** Set up React Router for a "single student" view
- [ ] **Cycle 3:** Make the single student route functional
- [ ] **Cycle 4 (Bonus):** Delete a student

## Steps

- [ ] Build out the Redux store, including:
  - [ x] Action type
  - [ x] Action creator
  - [ x] Thunk creator
  - [ x] Initial state
  - [ x] Reducer
  - NOTE: See the dummy data in `components/StudentList.js` for an example of how the data will be structured
- [ ] Test your Redux store functionality
  - Dispatch a few actions to your reducer, then check the logs in your console. Is it doing what you expect?
- [ ] Once done and tested, `git checkout cycle-1`
